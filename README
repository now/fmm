                   Future Memories mat.se code test

  This is an implementation of the Future Memories mat.se code test.
  It stays true to the task, except that all data is written to one
  file instead of three.  The data is written as JSON to stdandard
  output.  To run the code:

    % go run main.go

  To run the tests:

    % go test ./...

  There’s an issue when mat.se’s API doesn’t return a proper HTTP
  status and instead gives the status as part of an error object:

    {"error":"404: Not Found","message":"/api/product/listCategory"}

  The code doesn’t currently handle this issue.

  Also, the fact that I seem to be throttled from using this part of
  the API means that I haven’t been able to generate a valid result
  yet.
